Project title : Student Management System (SMS)
Purpose/Objectives:
-Purpose : The main purpose of the SMS is automate the management of the student information, academic records. The system aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of student data handling, enabling educators, administrators, and parents to access essential information quickly . 
Objectives
Giving the administrators the tool the need to control user managements, manage the subjects information.
Giving the instructor can be view all list of students , access assigned class.
Giving the students the ability register, access the class they are assigned, take part in the online testing, submit the homework, project, student can be reports the teacher they are learn.

Timeframe: All task is finished from 4 month.
Customer/Sponsor:
The primary customer and sponsor of the project is FPT University.
Project Milestones:
1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis (Week 1-3)
2. System Design  (Week 4-5)
3. Development and UT Testing (Week 6-10)

Request 3:
1. Functional Testing (QC)
Purpose: Confirm that the system functions according to the required necessities.
When: After development of each module and some time recently integration testing.
How: Testers create and execute test cases for each functional requirement, guaranteeing that the framework carries on as anticipated.
2. Usability Testing (QC)
Purpose: Guarantee that the system is user-friendly and meets wants of the end-users in terms of route, format, and plan.
When: After the UI/UX plan is executed and before system testing.
How: End-users are inquired to perform particular assignments inside the framework, and their input is assembled to recognize zones for enhancement.
3. Setup Administration Reviews
Purpose: Ensure that all extend artifacts (code, records, etc.) are appropriately versioned, put away, and overseen.
When: Throughout the project, especially during and after major updates.
How: The project manager or a designated team member conducts reviews to guarantee compliance with setup administration strategies.
4. Regression Testing (QC)
Purpose: Ensure that new changes or additions do not negatively affect existing functionalities.
When: After any significant change or addition to the system.
How: Testers re-run previous test cases to verify that the system still performs as expected after modifications.
5. Performance Testing (QC)
Purpose: Confirm that the system can handle expected loads without performance degradation.
When: Before deployment, after the system is fully integrated.
How: The system is subjected to recreated loads (e.g., different clients getting to the framework at the same time) to degree reaction times, throughput, and soundness.
