Project Name: FU Connection

Request 1: 
Detailed Project Description
What: FU Connection is a web-based platform pointed at upgrading communication and collaboration inside the FPT University.
Why: Currently, FU needs a centralized platform for understudies, workforce, and staff to put, through share data, and collaborate on scholastic and extracurricular ventures. FU Connection looks for to fill this crevice, cultivating a more dynamic and locked in campus environment.
How: The project will involve:

Requirement Gathering: Understanding user needs and expectations through surveys, interviews, and center groups.
Design and Development: Building the web platform using suitable technologies (e.g., React, Node.js, MongoDB).
Testing: Thorough testing to guarantee usefulness, ease of use, and security.
Deployment: Propelling the stage and giving user preparing and support.

Key Characteristics:
Purpose: To create a centralized stage for communication, collaboration, and data sharing inside the FU.
Timeframe: Estimated project duration is 6 months.
Customer: The project is supported by the FU Student Committee and supported by the IT Office.

Project Milestones:
Completion of requirement gathering and documentation.
Finalization of system plan and architecture.
Advancement of center functionalities.
Successful completion of testing stages.
Deployment and user training.

Success Criteria:
High user selection rate.
Positive user feedback and fulfillment..
Increased engagement and collaboration within the FU community.

Project Constraints:
Budget: Constrained budget distributed for advancement and arrangement.
Resources: Accessibility of talented engineers and IT faculty.
Technical: Guaranteeing compatibility with existing FU systems and foundation.
