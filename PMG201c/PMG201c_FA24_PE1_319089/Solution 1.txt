Project Name: Website Revamp System
Purpose/Objectives: The venture points to redesign and improve the user experience (UX) of a web learning platform. The most objective is to create the stage simpler to utilize, increment client engagement, and optimize the interface for portable devices. By addressing issues like moderate stacking times, confusing route, and obsolete plan, the extend intends to create the stage more available and move forward client satisfaction. This, in turn, will help increment the number of course sign-ups.
Timeframe: The project is temporary, with a set duration of 6 months. It will begin in January 2024 and is expected to conclude by June 2024.
Project Milestones:
- January 2024 – Planning Phase: Define goals, gather requirements, and finalize the design blueprint.
- February 2024 – Prototype Development: Build wireframes and initial mockups for the platform’s homepage and key learning pages.
- March 2024 – User Testing & Feedback: Conduct usability testing with a select group of students and instructors. Collect feedback to refine designs.
- April 2024 – Development Phase: Start coding the new design, including mobile optimization.
- May 2024 – Quality Assurance & Bug Fixes: Conduct thorough testing for functionality, responsiveness, and security.
- June 2024 – Launch: Release the new version of the platform to all users. Perform analysis and optimization.
Project Constraints:
- Cost: Budget is capped at $50,000, including all development, design, and testing.
- Resources: The project team consists of 1 project manager, 2 UX/UI designers, 3 developers, and 2 testers.
- Quality: The new design must be intuitive, mobile-responsive, and accessible, meeting WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.

Duration of Each Path:
- Path 1: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G
Duration: 4 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 32 days
- Path 2: A -> B -> C -> E -> F -> G
Duration: 4 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 24 days
- Path 3: A -> B -> D -> F -> H -> I
Duration: 4 + 2 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 3 = 32 days
- Path 4: A -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G
Duration: 4 + 3 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 30 days
- Path 5: A -> B -> C -> D -> F -> G
Duration: 4 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 7 + 3 = 27 days
- Path 6: A -> B -> H -> I
Duration: 4 + 2 + 8 + 3 = 17 days
Critical Path: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G or A -> B -> D -> F -> H -> I
Duration: 32 days
The critical path is the longest path, which is either A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G or A -> B -> D -> F -> H -> I, both having a duration of 32 days.
This path determines the overall project duration. Any delay in activities along the critical path will directly affect the project’s completion time.

Request 5:
Schedule Performance Index (SPI): SPI= EV/PV = 2.3 million/2.8 million = 0.82
Cost Performance Index (CPI): CPI = EV/AC= 2.3 million / 2.1 million = 1.10
Schedule Variance (SV): SV=EV−PV=2.3million−2.8million=−0.5million
Cost Variance (CV): CV=EV−AC=2.3 million−2.1 million=0.2 million
Estimate at Completion (EAC): EAC=TotalPlannedCost / CPI=6 million / 1.10=5.45 million
Estimate to Complete (ETC): ETC=EAC−AC=5.45 million−2.1 million=3.35 million
Summary of Findings and Recommendations:
The project is behind schedule, with an SPI of 0.82 and a schedule variance (SV) of -0.5 million dollar, indicating delays. To recover, actions like reallocating resources, prioritizing critical tasks, and increasing working hours may be necessary. On the cost side, the project is performing well, with a CPI of 1.10 and a cost variance (CV) of + 0.2 million dollar, suggesting it is under budget. The project is forecasted to cost 5.45 million dollar, which is below the 6 million dollar budget, but the schedule delay needs to be addressed.
Recommended Adjustments:
- Schedule: Accelerate work by reallocating resources, increasing workforce, or streamlining processes.
- Cost: Continue to monitor costs carefully, but no immediate action is needed to reduce spending, as the project is under budget.
- Monitoring: Regularly track both schedule and cost performance to ensure the project stays on track and make adjustments as needed.
=> By addressing the schedule delays while maintaining cost efficiency, the project can potentially be completed under budget, though extra effort will be needed to meet the original timeline.
