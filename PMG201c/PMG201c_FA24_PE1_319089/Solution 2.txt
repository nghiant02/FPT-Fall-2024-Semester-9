Project Milestones:
- Kickoff Meeting: January 1, 2024
- Requirement Analysis Complete: January 31, 2024
- Prototype Testing: March 15, 2024
- Implementation Phase Completion: May 15, 2024
- Final Handover and Evaluation: June 30, 2024
Key Constraints:

Request 2:
1. School Administration (e.g., Principal, Board Members)
Power: High
Interest: High
Engagement: Supportive and Leading
Reason: They have the authority to approve budgets and set priorities. Their leadership is critical for project success.
2. Teachers
Power: Low
Interest: High
Engagement: Neutral to Supportive
Reason: Teachers will be end-users of the LMS. While they have less impact on by and large choices, their buy-in is imperative for selection
3. Parents
Power: Low
Interest: Low to Neutral
Engagement: Unaware to Neutral
Reason: They are indirect beneficiaries, concerned mainly with how it impacts student performance.
Stakeholder Management Strategy:
- School Administration: Engage them continuously through strategic updates, ensure alignment with their vision, and seek approval at each milestone.
- Teachers: Conduct workshops to address concerns, highlight benefits, and involve them in prototype testing to increase buy-in.
- Parents: Use newsletters and open forums to educate them about the project’s benefits to their children and solicit feedback.

Request 5: Cost Performance Index (CPI): CPI = EV/AC = 2.3/2.1 = 1.1
Schedule Performance Index (SPI): SPI: EV/PV = 2.3/2.8 = 0.82
Comments:
Current Status:
- The project is over-performing on cost with a CPI > 1.
- The project is behind schedule with an SPI < 1.
Forecast:
- Likely to complete under budget if the current trend continues.
- Schedule delays need immediate attention to avoid further slippage.
Recommended Adjustment:
- Allocate additional resources to critical path tasks to accelerate progress.
- Increase communication frequency to identify bottlenecks early.
